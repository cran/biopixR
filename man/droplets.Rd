\description{
The image displays a water-oil emulsion with droplets observed through
brightfield microscopy. It is formatted as 'cimg' and sized at 151 Ã— 112
pixels. The droplets vary in size, and some contain microbeads, which adds
complexity. Brightfield microscopy enhances the contrast between water and
oil, revealing the droplet arrangement.
