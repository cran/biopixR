#' Droplets containing microbeads
#'
#' The image displays a water-oil emulsion with droplets observed through
#' brightfield microscopy. It is formatted as 'cimg' and sized at 151 Ã— 112
#' pixels. The droplets vary in size, and some contain microbeads, which adds
#' complexity. Brightfield microscopy enhances the contrast between water and
#' oil, revealing the droplet arrangement.
