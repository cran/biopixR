#' Image of microbeads in luminescence channel
#'
#' The image shows red fluorescence rhodamine microbeads measuring
#' 151 x 112 pixels. The fluorescence channel was used to obtain the image,
#' resulting in identical dimensions and positions of the beads as in the
#' original image (droplets).
#'
